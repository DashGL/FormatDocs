# 3D Mesh, Texture, and Compression Formats for Retro Video Games

Welcome to the documentation for reverse-engineered 3D mesh, texture, and compression formats used in retro video games. This project aims to provide detailed, easy-to-follow documentation for these formats to help developers, researchers, and enthusiasts better understand and work with these assets.

This site is built using [AstroJS](https://astro.build/) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), ensuring fast, modern, and easy-to-navigate static documentation.

## Introduction

The purpose of this documentation is to share insights gained from reverse-engineering various 3D mesh, texture, and compression formats used in retro video game development. These formats were often proprietary and optimized for the hardware limitations of their time. Understanding them can be useful for game preservation, modding, and educational purposes.

## Features

- Detailed format specifications for various 3D mesh and texture formats used in retro games
- Guides for reverse engineering and working with these formats
- Examples and tools to help visualize the formats
- Compression methods used in older games and how to decode them
- Built with [AstroJS](https://astro.build/), offering a lightweight, fast, and static site
- Powered by [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) for documentation-friendly navigation
